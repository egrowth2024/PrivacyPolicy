# Privacy Policy for DoseWell

**Effective Date:** [August 15, 2025]

Thank you for choosing DoseWell. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information DoseWell handles, why, and how we protect your privacy. Your trust is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your data.

Our core privacy promise is simple: **All your data is stored exclusively and securely on your own device. It is never transmitted, collected, or shared with us or any third party.**

### Information We Handle

DoseWell is designed to function entirely offline. To provide its core features, the app handles the following information that you provide:

*   **Medication Information:** This includes the medication name, dosage details (amount and unit), scheduling information (start/end dates, frequency, and specific dosing times), and any additional notes you choose to add.
*   **Dose Adherence Records:** Information about whether you have marked a dose as "taken" or "skipped," including the specific time you logged the dose.

This information is classified as sensitive health data.

### How We Use Your Information

The information you enter into DoseWell is used **only** to enable the app's features on your device. Specifically, this includes:

*   **To Send You Reminders:** Your medication schedule is used by your device's Alarm Manager to generate timely notifications so you don't miss a dose.
*   **To Display Your Schedule:** Your data is used to populate the in-app calendar, the daily medication list, and the countdown timer to your next dose.
*   **To Maintain Your History:** Your adherence records are used to display your medication history, helping you track your progress.

### Data Storage and Security

*   **Local Storage Only:** All information you enter into DoseWell is stored in a private, local database on your device. This data **NEVER** leaves your phone. We do not have servers, and we cannot access your information.
*   **Security:** Your data is protected by the standard security measures of the Android Operating System, which sandboxes app data to keep it isolated and secure.
*   **Data Deletion:** You have full control over your data. You can delete any medication entry or your entire history from within the app at any time. Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all of its data from your device.

### Device Permissions

DoseWell requires the following permissions to function correctly:

*   **Notifications (Post Notifications):** This permission is essential to deliver the medication reminders you set up.
*   **Alarms & Reminders (Schedule Exact Alarms):** This permission allows DoseWell to schedule precise alarms that will trigger reliably, even when the device is in a low-power state.

### Children's Privacy

DoseWell is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.
